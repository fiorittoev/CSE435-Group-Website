  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    Software-based electronic control systems are increasingly being used in the automotive industry to
    provide convenience and safety features to vehicle drivers and passengers, with increasing levels of
    automation and control authority. 
    <br/>
    A growing trend is to assist the driver in maintaining safe control over
    the motion of the vehicle in a variety of circumstances including, but not limited to, congested traffic
    conditions, adverse weather and road conditions, varying states of health of vehicle equipment, and
    varying skill levels of drivers. 
    <br/>
    Previously such assist has been provided in the form of information or
    warnings to the driver, but increasingly such assist will be provided by actively manipulating actuators
    that control vehicle longitudinal acceleration and deceleration, lateral direction, and vertical
    displacement. 
    <br/>
    The long term trend is towards partial or even fully autonomous operation of a single
    vehicle, or even of groups of vehicles.

  <h2>Project Description</h2> 
  <h3>Traffic Jam Assist</h3>
  <p>
    Traffic Jam Assist is based on the Adaptive Cruise Control(ACC) system common to most modern
    vehicles. Basic Cruise control simply maintains a constant speed. While it will adjust to uphill and
    downhill conditions, it depends on the driver to determine if you are getting too close to the vehicle in
    front and adjust the speed or even disengage. 
    <br/>
    ACC uses a forward looking radar to identify a target
    vehicle and determine the closing rate to that target. Ideally the closing rate should be zero. It can be
    positive in that the closing distance is growing and no action is needed. If negative then you are getting
    too close to the target and need to slow down and maintain a set distance. Typically the drive has 3
    selections for the distance. 
    <br/>
    In addition if a forward looking camera is available you can add lane
    following which keeps you in the middle of the lane you are in. If you try to change lanes without
    signaling it will resist your attempt. Not to the point of not allowing it, but is will be annoying.
    To this we wish to add, only on particular limited access highways, the ability to adjust to traffic flow by
    stopping behind the target vehicle in the case of slow and stopped traffic. 
    <br/>
    If the target vehicle then
    starts back up the vehicle you are in will also start up, following at the set distance and controlling the
    closing rate. Your set speed has not changed and should you change lanes your vehicle will resume the
    set speed assuming there are no other target vehicles.
