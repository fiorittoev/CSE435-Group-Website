10/28 8:58 PM

Hey, I put the use case diagram I came up with into the doc. I know the only use case we have currently is that the driver is stopped by traffic but I think it makes sense to break out the different traffic speeds (slower/faster than the cruise control is set at) into different use cases since the system will behave differently depending on which one it is. Lmk if you guys are okay with that and if so I can fill out the use case templates for all the use cases I have in the diagram

Smallfield, Amelia whats the status on section 3 of the doc?

 
Meeting Agenda 11,11,2025.docx

 
I'm planning to do section 3 of the doc tonight - it will be done by tomorrow morning

 
I can also look at adding the ability to accelerate to the prototype if you guys would like to have that done for tomorrow

 
we have acceleration, if you want to improve steering that would be great, not very realistic rn

 
I cleaned up our SRS V1 and turned it in

 
sent out the email to the customer
